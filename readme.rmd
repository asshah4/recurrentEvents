# __card__

## Cardiovascular Research Data

The inspiration for `card` was to create useful functions and analytical approaches in computational neurocardiology, with a on electrocardiography and epidemiology. 

The areas of focus of this package are the following:

- handling of recurrent and circadian events
- epidemiological focus on effective model building

## Installation

You can install the released version of __card__ from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r}
install.packages("card")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shah-in-boots/card")
```

## Usage

The intent for this `card` is to develop several key functions for the analysis of recurrent or cyclical data, and assistance with epidemiological approaches to regression modeling.

The key features are:

1. Sample datasets
2. Cosinor analysis 
3. Recurrent events
4. Model building

```{r}
library(card)
```

### Datasets

* Cardiovascular disease outcomes with recurrent events
* Vectorcardiography data in a high-risk cohort
* Continuous electrocardiography recordings in a clinical cohort with quantitative stress data

```{r}
# ECG data
data("twins")
head(twins)

# Outcomes data
data("mims")
head(mims)

# VCG data
data("geh")
head(geh)
```

### Cosinor Analysis

This modeling algorithm requires only base `R`, which allows internal flexibility for modeling heuristics and improved efficiency. For the user, it also allows standard modeling tools/approaches, and a flexible user interface that accounts for individual/population analysis and single/multiple component analysis.

There are other cosinor models available in `R`, however they do not allow for simple multiple-component or individual/population analysis in a method that is tidy (for both `tidyverse` and `tidymodels` approaches).

```{r}
m <- cosinor(rDYX ~ hour, twins, tau = c(24, 12))
summary(m)
ggcosinor(m)

head(augment(m))
```
